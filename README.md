# Dueling Wizards

This is a variation of a basic computer game version of the hand game Rock, Paper, Scissors (a.k.a. Rochambeau, sometimes as Stone, Paper, Scissors). This README.md is likely to eventually include explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to a live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, and resourced used. The headings below are placeholders and subject to change.

## Motivation

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that manipluates the DOM, to create a simple game that is two player (player/user versus the computer), has a win state and lose state, and includes multiple rounds.
