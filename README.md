This is a variation of a basic computer game version of the hand game Rock, Paper, Scissors (a.k.a. Rochambeau, sometimes as Stone, Paper, Scissors). The headings below are placeholders and subject to change.

## Motivation

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that manipluates the DOM, to create a simple game that is two player (player/user versus the computer), has a win state and lose state, and includes multiple rounds.
