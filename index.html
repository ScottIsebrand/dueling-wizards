    <div class="introduction">
      <p>
        You and fellow Elementalist wizard Osmanwic are fighting a duel using
        spells, which of which harnesses the power of one of the Four Elements:
        Water, Fire, Earth, and Wind. How much a duelist's spell weakens their
        opponent is affected by the opponent's cast spell, as shown in the
        Damage Table below. It is customary among Elementatists to contest each
        other five times per duel, at which point the wizard who has been
        weakened the most yields. When both have been equally weakened, they
        agree to call the duel a draw.
